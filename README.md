# metasploit-cve-search
Automates searching CVEs in the Metasploit database of exploits. 

## Setup
This script has been tested with Kali Linux 2020.4 in a virtual machine environment. It is suggested you work with this script in a similar environment. 
The minimal requirements are: 
- An installation of Linux (preferably Debian-like)
- Metasploit Framework, initialized
- Python 3

Follow the documentation to initialize Metasploit. You should be able to run `msfconsole` in the terminal if it is properly setup. 

## Usage
First, edit the `cve_list.txt` file to include the CVE-IDs you want to search in the Metasploit database. 
It should look something like (ideally): 
```txt
CVE-2018-0151
CVE-2018-0171
CVE-2018-0304
2018-0310
2019-1614
2018-0293
2020-3454
2018-0150
```
However, the script can also handle various formats as long as the "YYYY-NNNNNNN" part of the CVE-ID can be found. 
Example entries: 
```txt
Microsoft CVE-2020-1208: Jet Database Engine Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
Oracle Security Alert: Java Runtime Environment Libraries vulnerability (CVE-2012-3174)
Google Chrome Vulnerability: CVE-2020-6427
```

To start processing, simply run the `build_and_run.py` script, and the `results.txt` will include the CVE's that had a match in the database. 
```sh
python3 build_and_run.py
```
